- Write the property handler in C++ to support Explorer-native tagging
- Will need to communicate between Python and C++ via IPC (e.g., sockets, named pipes, or COM automation)

- This part of the project will be done after migrating this app to the Productivity Pack (where the native tagging C++ code is already written)
